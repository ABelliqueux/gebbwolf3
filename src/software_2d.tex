\section{Menu Phase: 2D Renderer}
The menu phase is renderer by the 2D renderer which is tile based. The screen is divided into tiles as follow:\\
DRAWING\\
Bla bla bla\\
Assets are called "pic" as opposed to sprites in 3D phases. Pics  are all Huffman-compressed (VGADICT, VGAHEAD, 
VGAGRAPH).

Chapter 48 from michael abrash book
