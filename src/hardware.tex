With a few exceptions, hardware mannufacturers had not embrased the game industry yet: Those machines were designed to display static images and crunch integers. Real-time 3D, fractions and smooth 60 fps animations were not part of the blueprints.

\section{CPU}
  \subsection{History}
  The ubiquitous manufacturer was Intel and its x86 line of microprocessors. Two other companies were also producing Intel clones: AMD and Cyrix but their mediocre performances denied then any significant market shares. Intel's 80286 processors from 1982 were dissapearing and were being replaced by their first 32bits processor: The i386 released in 1985. Moore's law was in full effect and the high end 386-DX 33Mhz was an obvious beast when plotten on a MIPs\footnote{Million Instructions per Second.} histogram  :

Include comparaison with NES, C64 and Amiga  ?
 
 \textbf{\underline{Note :}} The huge performance difference between the 386-SX and the 386-DX is due to their bus width: The DX bus is twice as wide (32 bits) as the SX (16 bits) and therefore can retrieve data faster.
 \\

To keep things into perspective, a modern 2014 processor such as Intel Sandy Bridge operates at close to 30,000 Mips:

COMPARE WITH TODAY MIPS

  Wolfenstein 3D recommended configuration would end up being a 386 processor (while still being playable on a 286). It may be surprising after descriving how powerful
  But all that power was not useful for a 3D engine and it had to do with how calculations are done in a 3D game. In order to do trigonometry, operations need
  to keep track of fractions. Noawadays, developers are commonly using \emph{float} or 
  \emph{double} which are floating point types. Floating point are great, since they keep track of the fractionnal part of a number and the operations on it:


  But there was a huge problem with the hardware of 1992: CPU had no floating point unit. Which means that even though you could use floating point, those operations were emulated in software and therefore impossibly slow: Floating Point could not be used.

  Without the ability to do proper trigonometry, the perspective of building a 3D engine looked bleak.

  386 very powerful (run linux 4GB, MMU) buy a major obstable stood between the programmer and the machine. It was the operating system and its name was DOS 4.0.
