The game ended up a collosal financial success. Sales were so good that six episodes of 10 maps (60 maps!) were not enough to satisfy players:\\
\par
\begin{itemize}
\item Episode 1: Escape from Wolfenstein
\item Episode 2: Operation: Eisenfaust
\item Episode 3: Die, Fuhrer, Die!
\item Episode 4: A Dark Secret
\item Episode 5: Trail of the Madman
\item Episode 6: Confrontation
\end{itemize}
id Software ended up developing sequels but also contracted companies to make even more maps.

\section{Spears of Destiny}
Released on September 18, 1992 and entirely done by id Software, Spears Of Destiny used the same game engine but with new graphics, music and levels. It is a prequel to the adventures of wolf hero: B.J. Blazkowicz and consist in one additional episode made of 21 levels.\\

 To work on a sequel made sense for two reasons:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item Sales were so good it would have been silly not to provide something for which there was so much demand.
 \item It gave time to the engineering team to build the next generation of engine and tools while keeping the design and graphic team busy.
 \end{enumerate}
Despite using the same engine, SOD is nonetheless innovative since it introduces huge transparent sprites to simulate vegetation and also tries to break away from the orthogonal world contraint with clever map design:

 I look like piracy was a problem with Wolf3D so SOD shipped with a copy protection mechanism: A set of random question which could only be answered with the game manual:\\

 Of course, as usual an easter egg is hidden. Some words are always a valid answer. Among them "Joshua": a reference to 1983 movie WarGames:\\

Trivia: Angel of Death looked like a demon and was a good insight into what would come next: Doom.




It was essentially a mod of Wolfenstein 3D. SOD helps to put things into perspective when it comes to being open source and allow people to figure out the file formats. SOD may not have sold as well had the game been open.\\
No a shareware version  but  2-level playable demo was distributed\\
