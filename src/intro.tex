Wolfenstein 3D was released on May, 5th 1992 and established the First Person Shooter genre. The beautiful graphics, high framerate, crisp sounds effect and engaging musics were universally acclaimed. Within a year more than 100,000 units had been sold over the mail\footnote{The game was distributed via shareware: You had to mail money to get the full version}, bringing fame and a little bit of fortune to the team who built it: id Software.\\
\\
The many fans did not stop at beating the game. Because they wanted to modify it and make their own characters and maps, they started to explore and reverse engineer the engine. Within a few months the assets formats were well known and people released mods\footnote{MODified version.} with altered graphics, sounds effects, music and maps. The core of the game however, the 3D engine and the secrets of its speed remained mostly unknown.\\
\\
It was kept secret for an obvious reason: A good game engine was considered the main asset of a game company. As a mean to outperform competitors it was a good business practice to keep other programmers  uneducated in order to gain technological advantage and generate profit.\\
\\
But a few people within id Software did not see things that way. Instead of going along with what was common sense, they wanted to embrace players enthusiasm and fully open the source code to the public. After many internal debate, id Software did the unthinkable: On July 21, 1995 they uploaded a zip archive on \emph{ftp.idsoftware.com} containing the full source code of the engine with all instructions to build it\footnote{They were not totally crazy: They had built a game engine making Wolfenstein 3D obsolete: Doom was released on December 10, 1993}.\\

   Programming is not a zero-sum game. Teaching something to a fellow programmer doesn't take it away from you. I'm happy to share what I can, because I'm in it for the love of programming.\\

\\
Opening the code did not only allow MODding and educate programers: It had two unforeseen consequences:\\
\\
It allowed the software to live long after the target hardware and operating system died. With access to the source, programmers were able to maintain and port the engine to new hardware and operating systems: Twenty years after the release of Wolfenstein 3D you can still play the game on anything with a CPU, some RAM and a framebuffer. \\
\\
A second unexpected side effect was the creation of a window back in time looking right into 1992. As a technical writer on \emph{fabiensanglard.net} I thought i would never take a look at these old thing. But when out of curiosity I took a peek, I could not stop reading: I was mesmerized. The more I read, the more I came to realize one very important thing: The IBM PC was designed for office work, not gaming. It was meant to crunch integers for static screens such as word processors and spreadsheets. What id Software did in 1991 was not just program a machine: They repurposed something built to do office work and turned it into the best gaming platform in the world\footnote{A few other companies, such as Origins and LucasArts where also doing amazing things: I focus on Id because we have the source code!}.\\
\\
But why go through so much trouble? After all if you were a game company and you wanted to make video games, you had hardware dedicated to this very specific thing: video game console! The Megadrive, the NES and the Neo-Geo had sprite engine which albeit small limitations such as size and number allowed to move something on the screen by simply updating its $(x,y)$ coordinates. Heck if really you wanted to use a personal computer for gaming why not use an Amiga which was packed with coprocessors dedicated to smooth animation?\\
\\
The reason is: framebuffer. The kind of game they wanted to do could not be done with a sprite engine or tricks from a Copper\footnote{Nickname of a powerful Amiga co-processor allowing operations at hsync level}. Every frames, 70 times per seconds, it has to draw a full screen, pixel per pixel in the framebuffer and ship it to the screen. That task required a particularly powerful CPU. No console or Amiga\footnote{Jimmy Maher advances an interesting theory in his book "The Future was here: The Commodore Amiga": People wanted to play First Person Shooter, which the Amiga architecture did not allow: This inability ultimately provoked the downfall of Commodore's best seller.} could do the job as the mips\footnote{Million Instructions Per Second.} graph shows.

PC had a fast CPU and a framebuffer but everything else was a nightmare:
\begin{itemize}
\item No double buffer making smooth animation next to impossible.
\item CPU could only do integer operations, 3D engines requires fractions.
\item RAM adressing was not flat but segmented resulting in complex and error prone pointer mathematics.
\item The pixel of the VGA were not square: the framebuffer was distorted on screen.
\item The sound ecosystem was fragmented: Various sound systems had different capabilities and expectations.
\item Various RAM drivers exposed the RAM and made it available differently.
\end{itemize}

At first sight it did not look like much could be done to make a 3D game possible. Yet programmers of this era made it happen thanks to their ingeniosity and hard work. To help readers to understand the extend of the task, the book emphasis first on the hardware limitations then goes on to describe how the software circumvented and sometimes exploited these limitations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Chapter I: Hardware: The limits.
\item Chapter II: People: The team\footnote{The description is logistic. For the human aspect, read David Kushner's chef d'oeuvre: "Masters of Doom''} pushing the edges.
\item Chapter III: Software: Wolfenstein game engine.
\end{itemize}
\par
\textbf{\underline{Trivia :}} The game was inspired by the 1981 Apple II title "Castle Wolfesntein" by Silas Warner. The Apple version was stealth oriented (Wolfesntein "Profound Carnage" 3D was a clear departure from the original theme) but really stood out by its unprecedented use of digitized voices.
