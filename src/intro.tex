Wolfenstein 3D is a game that needs little introduction. Released in May 1992, it achieved instant legendary status and laid down the foundations for First Person Shooter. Universaly acclaimed, the beautiful graphics, crisp digitalized sounds, engaging musics and oustanging game design made the game engine sing. Within a year more than 100,000 units had been sold bringing fame and a little bit of fortune to the studio producing it: id Software.\\
\\
The many fans did not stop at beating the game. Because they wanted to modify it, they started to explore the binaries and reverse engineer them. Within a few months the assets formats were well known and people released mods\footnote{MODified version.} with altered graphics, sounds effects, music and maps. The core of the game however, the secrets of its speed remained mostly unknown.\\
\\
It was a closely guarded secret for an obvious reason:. A good game engine was considered the main asset of a game company. As a mean to outperform competitiors it was paramount to hide its algorithms and data structures.\\
\\
But a faction within id Software did not see things that way. Instead of going along with what commercial common sense would dictate, they wanted to embrace players enthousiasm and fully open the source code to the public. After many internal discussions [ASK JOHN HOW HARD IT WAS.] id Software did the unthinkable: On July 21, 1995 they uploaded a zip archive on \emph{ftp.idsoftware.com} containing source code with instructions to build an executable.\\

Pessimists would have forecasted the demise of a company foolish enough to give away its technology: Nobody had ever released the source of a mondial hit. But instead of destroying them, it turned id Software into icon. A monument dedicated to the Right Thing that gamers and programmers could relate to.\\
\\
Sharing their hard gained knowledge enabled unumerable programers to become better engineers. But it also allowed the software to live and long after the dedicated hardware ceased to exist. Twenty years after the release of Wolfenstein 3D you can still play the game on anything with a CPU and some RAM. \\
\\
An other unexpected side effect of opening the source was the generation of a window back in time. As a techincal writer on \emph{fabiensanglard.net} I thought i would never take a look at this old thing. But when out of curiosity I took a peek, I could not stop reading: I was mezmerized. The more I read, the more I came to realize one very important thing: The IBM PC was designed for office work, not gaming. It was meant to crunch integers and display static images.\\
\\ 
Wolfenstein 3D engine had the hardware perform something it was not meant to do.\\
\\
It would be an easy mistake to look at a mips graph such as Figure \ref{fig:game_console_vs_PC} comparing the power of a PC and the gaming system of the time to conclude that because PC were so powerful it was ''easy'' to write a game for this machine. \\

But game console were designed around animation. They all featured coprocessors and Graphic Processing Unit relying on tile engine. Animating a sprite on the screen was just about to update its $(x,y)$ coordinates.\\
\\
On the contrary, IBM PC animation was next to impossible. Not even to mention many many other obstacles. This is where the root of my admiration for Wolfenstein 3D started: id Software achieved the impossible by building a game engine able to not only workaround the many limitations of the machine but sometimes turn them into an advantage.\\
\\
I saw beauty in this ability to repurpose a machine to do something even the builder did not think was possible. It takes optimist, creativity, passion and dedication to be able to leave the safe harbour of that machine manual in order to Explore, Dream and Discover. This is what this book is dedicated to.\\

 \textbf{\underline{Disclaimer :}} The description that follows is very technical and will appeal mostly to programmers. If you are more into the human aspect of game programming I would recommend instead to read David Kushner's chef d'oeuvre: "Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture".\\
 \\
This book tries to widen the window back on early 90s by not only describing the code but by givng a complete overview of three pilars of game production:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Hardware
\item People
\item Software
