Wolfenstein 3D, released on May 5th, 1992, established the First Person Shooter genre. The game design, powered by an engine enabling beautiful 256 color graphics, speed, high framerate, clever AI, crisp sound effects, and engaging music, was universally acclaimed. Within a year more than 100,000 units had been sold\footnote{The game was distributed via shareware.}, bringing fame and a little bit of fortune to the team who built it: id Software.\\

However, fans did not stop at beating the game. Driven by a desire to modify it and make their own characters and maps, they started to explore and reverse engineer. Within a few months the asset formats were well-known and  mods\footnote{MODified version.} were released with altered graphics, sounds effects, music, and maps. However, the core of the game - the 3D engine and the secrets of its speed - remained mostly unknown.\\
\\
It was kept secret for an obvious reason: a powerful engine is an essential asset for a gaming company. As a means to outperforming competitors, it's good business practice to keep other programmers clueless. This allows for maintaining a technological advantage, making better games, and generating more profit.\\
\\
However, a few people within id Software did not see things that way. Instead of going along with what was common sense, they wanted to embrace players' enthusiasm and fully open the source code to the public. After much internal debate, id Software did the unthinkable: on July 21st, 1995 they uploaded a zip archive on \emph{ftp.idsoftware.com} containing the full source code of the engine with instructions to build it\footnote{They were not totally crazy, they had built a new game engine which made Wolfenstein 3D obsolete: Doom was released on December 10, 1993.}.\\

   Programming is not a zero-sum game. Teaching something to a fellow programmer doesn't take it away from you. I'm happy to share what I can, because I'm in it for the love of programming.\\

\\
Opening the code did much more than enable programmers. It had two unforeseen consequences.\\
\\
First, it allowed the software to live long after the target hardware and operating system disappeared. With access to the source, programmers were able to maintain and port the engine to new hardware and operating systems. Twenty years after the release of Wolfenstein 3D, you can still play the game on anything with a CPU, some RAM, and a framebuffer. \\
\\
Second, it created a window back in time to 1991. Having reviewed complex engines such as Quake III and Doom III on \emph{fabiensanglard.net}, I thought I would have merely skimmed over the Wolfenstein 3D engine and its "simple" raycasting technology. When I took a deeper look out of curiosity, something struck me and I could not stop. The more I read, the more I came to realize how the target machine, the IBM PC, was designed for office work rather than gaming. It was meant to crunch integers and display static images for word processing and spreadsheet applications. 
%This is the story this book is trying to tell. 
What id Software\footnote{Other companies, such as Origin System and LucasArts were also doing amazing things.} did in 1991 was not just program a machine - they re-purposed a tool built to do office work and turned it into the best gaming platform in the world.\\
\\
But why go through so much trouble? After all, if you were a game company and you wanted to make video games, you had video game consoles dedicated to this very specific task. The Genesis, the Super NES, and the Neo-Geo had sprite engines\label{sprite_engine_ref} which despite limitations such as size and number allowed movement of something on the screen by simply updating its $(x,y)$ coordinates. They were able to easily generate smooth animation at 60 frames per second, had controllers, had an audio system for sound and music, and were homogeneous (e.g. all SNES were the same). If you still really wanted to use a personal computer for a game, why not use an Amiga 500 which was packed with coprocessors designed for animation?\\
\\
The reason fits in one word: framebuffer. The kind of game id Software wanted to create could not be done with a sprite engine or tricks from a Copper\footnote{Nickname of a powerful Amiga co-processor allowing operations at hsync level.}. They wanted to shake the gaming world by providing an immersive experience in three dimensions. In order to do that they needed to draw a full screen, pixel by pixel, in a framebuffer before it was sent to the monitor. \\
\par
To draw all these pixels they needed a powerful CPU, and a PC outperformed any console on the market. No Amiga\footnote{Jimmy Maher advances an interesting theory in his book "The Future was here: The Commodore Amiga": People wanted to play First Person Shooters, which the Amiga architecture did not allow. This inability ultimately led to the downfall of Commodore's best seller.}, even with its co-processor, could rival a PC in terms of raw power.

With its fast CPU and 256KiB framebuffer, a 1991 PC looked promising at first. However, there were three seemingly impossible\footnote{The title of this book could have been "The Impossible Machine".} obstacles to overcome:
\begin{itemize}
\item The video system (called VGA) could not double buffer. It was not possible to have smooth animations without ugly artifacts called "tears" on the screen.
\item The CPU could only perform integer operations, but 3D calculations required keeping track of fractions.
\item The PC Speaker, the default sound device, could only produce square waves resulting in a bunch of "beeps" which were more annoying than anything else.
\end{itemize}
Beyond these major blockers were even more challenges:
\begin{itemize}
\item The RAM addressing mode was not flat but segmented, resulting in complex and error prone pointer arithmetic.
\item VGA pixels were not square: the framebuffer was stretched vertically when
transferred to the screen.
\item The audio ecosystem was fragmented. Each of the various sound systems had different capabilities and expectations.
\item The machine could only address 1MB of RAM. To go beyond required entering a fragmented ecosystem of drivers.
\item The bus was slow and I/O with the VRAM was a bottleneck. It was next to impossible to write a full framebuffer at 70 frames per second.
\end{itemize}

Overall, it looked like the machine was \emph{doom}ed to do boring things. But many around the world did not accept that and tinkered with the hardware to achieve unexpected results. How they did it is the \textit{raison d'\^etre} of this book. I've chosen to divide this book into three chapters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Chapter I: The Hardware. The five components of a PC from 1991.
\item Chapter II: The Team\footnote{This is an engineering book. For the human aspect read David Kushner's chef d'oeuvre: "Masters of Doom".}. The people pushing the edges.
\item Chapter III: The Software. The Wolfenstein 3D game engine.
\end{itemize}
\par
By first showing the hardware constraints, I hope programmers will develop an appreciation for the software and how it navigated obstacles, sometimes turning limitations into advantages.\\

 \bu{Trivia :} The name "Wolfenstein 3D" was inspired by the 1981 Apple II title "Castle Wolfenstein" from Silas Warner.\\

   We named it Wolfenstein 3-D because the original Castle Wolfenstein had a sequel called Beyond Caslte Wolfenstein, which was \#2. Our version of Castle Wolfenstein would be \#3 and it would be in 3-D. We used the same naming system with Catacomb, Catacomb 2, and Catacomb 3-D.

 \par The Apple version was stealth-oriented (Wolfenstein's "Profound Carnage" style was a clear departure from the original theme) but really stood out thanks to its unprecedented use of digitized voices.\\
 \par
 Initially the team believed they would be unable to use the Wolfenstein name due to trademark issues. They came up with multiple possible titles but ultimately managed to locate the lady in Baltimore, Maryland who owned the Wolfenstein trademark and bought it from her for \$5000 in 1992.\\
