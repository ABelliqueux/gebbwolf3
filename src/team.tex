id Software was funded during February 1991 by four people:

Wolfenstein 3D would be the first title for id but the team had already shipped no less than 13 games will working for their previous employer SoftDisk:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Dangerous Dave (1988)\footnote{Dangerous Dave is a solo project of John Romero predating Id's formation, but Id Software produced its first sequel and it is sometimes regarded as an early Id Software title. Later Dangerous Dave sequels were not made by Id, nor were later Catacomb titles.}
  \item Commander Keen
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Episode 1: Marooned on Mars (1990)
    \item Episode 2: The Earth Explodes (1991)
    \item Episode 3: Keen Must Die (1991)
    \item Keen Dreams (1991)
    \item Episode 4: Secret of the Oracle (1991)
    \item Episode 5: The Armageddon Machine (1991)
    \item Episode 6: Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter (1991)
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion (1991)
  \item Rescue Rover (1991)
  \item Rescue Rover 2 (1991)
  \item Shadow Knights (1991)
  \item Hovertank 3D (1991)
  \item Catacomb 3D: A New Dimension (1991)
\end{itemize}


Considering the magnitude and ambitions of the title, four more people were added to the team for a total of eight people.\\

INSERT PIC WITH NO PANTS

Every member was working with an high end 386 DX. As for combining game, tools and assets:\\

 \begin{fancyquotes}
We started with floppy data transfer, but we had a Novell network on coax Ethernet by the end. We didn't have a version control system.  Surprisingly, we went all the way to Quake 3 without one, then we started using Visual Source Safe.\\

\end{fancyquotes}
\section{Programming}

John Carmack took care of most of the runtime code. John Romero programmed many of the tools (editor, packers, â€¦). Jason Blochowiak was contracted to write important subsystems of the game (Input manager, Page Manager, Sound Manager, User Manager).\\
\\
The compiler was Borland C++ 3.1. To compensate for the tiny CRT, some of the developers used two screens (a very unusual thing at the time).\\
\begin{fancyquotes}
At that point, we wanted 21" monitors, but couldn't justify them.  I used a second mono monitor to allow Turbo Debugger 386 to keep the main screen in graphics mode while I stepped through the code.\\

Amazingly possible to recreate with DosBox


\begin{fancyquotes}
Jason was part of Id at the start, but we parted ways during Wolf development.

\section{Graphics assets}
The graphic assets comprise many aspects of the game:
\begin{itemize}
\item 2D Menus items.
\item 2D Action phase items.
\item Wall textures.
\item entities animations.
\end{itemize}
Those were the work of Adrian Carmack and Kevin Cloud. All of the work was done with Deluxe Paint on highend 386 DX computers. The greatest task was not to draw everything but to make the key decision of what colors would go in the palette.\\

Did they at least had a stylus or something like that ?	\\

\section{Maps}
Maps were created using the in-house editor called TED which is short for Tile EDitor. That tool was used for other games, the 2D scroller Commander Keen serie was entirely designed using TED.\\
\begin{figure}[H]

 \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{imgs/TED.eps}
 \caption{Tile EDitor screen} \label{fig:mips}
 \end{figure}
 
Everybody worked a little bit on the map but those were mostly the work of John Romero and Tom Hall. John Romero updated the editor TileEDitor (TED). Maps were plans based, 64x64.\\

 \textbf{\underline{Trivia :}} The source code of TED was released several years later. Inspecting the source was a mysterious \codeword{\_TOM.PIC}. Converted to PNG it looks as follow:\\
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
 \includegraphics[scale=1.5]{imgs/_tom.eps}
 \caption{Not so politically correct caricature.} \label{fig:mips}
 \end{figure}
The explanation was provided later by John Romero:\\
 \begin{fancyquotes}
   "Hahahaha! Wow, I forgot all about that picture. I can't believe it's 
in the TED5 source files! It's basically a pic that Adrian drew of Tom 
getting Adrian's dick blasted into his face with Adrian saying "Sorry!". 
It's because Tom and Adrian used to share a worktable together and Tom 
would always bump the table while Adrian was drawing graphics with the 
mouse and Tom would say, "Sorry!" That picture never appears in Ted5 
anywhere.\\

\section{Distribution}
Finally after having descrived all the assets created by the team I wanted to discuss a little bit about the distribution model and its intrinsics. Since id Software wanted to distribute the game as a shareware, it was paramount to make the game very easy to copy and exchange among people. So the decision was made to make the game fit on one single disk. This had several consequences:
- Few files
- Compression
- Archives
