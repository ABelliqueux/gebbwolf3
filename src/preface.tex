For the past 10 years, I have been writing articles explaining the internals of game engines. It all started back in 1999 when I downloaded the freshly opened source code of \mbox{Quake World} and eagerly opened it with \codeword{Visual Studio .NET}. After a few days of struggle I deleted the \codeword{quakesrc} folder, unable to make sense of anything and discouraged.

\bigskip

A few years later I came across legendary programmer and technical writer Michael Abrash's Graphics Programming Black Book. His beautiful articles described the essential algorithms and data structures used in Quake engine. Armed with this precious knowledge I went back to the code and read it all to the deep down.

\bigskip

This initial success was the sparkle that allowed me to associate hard work with deep knowledge. I thought many may be like me: Just in need of a roadmap to get them going. I started to write ``source  code reviews'' and published them on 
\href{http://fabiensanglard.net}{\textit{fabiensanglard.net}}. Over the years, I proceeded to publish more than fifty articles, always selecting legendary games such as Doom, Quake or Out Of This World. I would open the engine, explore the subsystems, understand the overall architecture and draw a map that hopefully saved a lot of time to other adventurous programmers.

\bigskip

Sharing my knowledge was a rewarding experience. Not only the feedback from readers was overwhelmingly positive, to attempt to explain something was the best way to verify that I understood the topic completely. More importantly, it allowed me to develop a very precious skill: Explain complicated things in simple terms. As a passionate teacher, I have learned over the years that good explanations need only two components: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item A deep understanding of the subject. 
\item As many and as pretty drawings one can make\footnote{"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software" by Charles Petzold is a superb example.}.
\end{itemize} 

\bigskip

Eventually I decided to take my articles to the next level and came up with this book which I hope will be the first of a series about revolutionary game engines. 

\bigskip

At first, it may seem like a waste of time to read those ``old'' source codes devote to extinct hardware, compilers and operating systems. But there is tremendous values in them. Not only they teach clean design, provide a deeper understanding of modern hardware and software, trigger new ideas and inspire innovation, they remind us of the constraints programmers from the past had to overcome. The code is a testimony of the talent and determination it once took to make a dream become true.
\bigskip

I hope this book will help you to understand the tremendous effort it was to create Wolfenstein 3D. I hope it will inspire us to emulate ourselves and keep on looking for the Right Thing to Do.
