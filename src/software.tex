\section{Source Code}
The game engine was released on July 21, 1995. 20 years later it is still there on the company ftp\footnote{Transfer File Protocol (along with Finger where J.C.Carmack used to blog) was commonly used in the 90s in the blessed time where you did not have to encrypt everything on the wire.}:\\ 
\\\codeword{ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/source/wolfsrc.zip}.\\
\\
\textbf{\underline{Trivia :}} Before the times of nmap and WireShark, ftp was commonly used to transfer files: It was simple and naively transmitted username and password in clear. Needless to say it did not age well...\\

\section{First Contact}
The file \codeword{woldsrc.zip} contains an other self-extracting PKZIP archive. It was a convenience back in the day but it is not practical nowadays. You can deflate it with:\\
\\\codeword{unzip WOLFSRC.1}.\\
\\The source code actually contains more than just \codeword{.H} (headers) and \codeword{.C} (code) files. Also present are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \codeword{.EQU}
\item \codeword{\_WL1.H}
\item \codeword{\_WL6.H}
\item \codeword{\_SOD.H}
\item \codeword{\_SDM.H}
\item \codeword{GOODSTUF.TXT} A letter from a POW playing Wolfenstein 3D.
\item \codeword{.ASM} Assembly optimized routines. Also contains  routines to access VGA and refresh screen.
\item \codeword{SIGNON.OBJ/}: The startup screen showing the system characteristic (RAM, EMS, XMS, Joystick, SoundCards) was linked in the binary. Because that screen was showed before any sub-system was started. TODO: This should be a trivia.
\item \codeword{GAMEPAL.OBJ/} Game palette. Hardcoded and linked in the executable for the same reason described previously.
\item \codeword{README/} How to build. You can find a complete tutorial in the Annexe of this book.

\section{Architecture}

The engine is made of sub-systems called Managers:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Memory
	\item Page
	\item Video
	\item Cache
	\item Sound
	\item User
	\item Input
\end{itemize}
Together they harness the machine to play sound, music and display the two phases of the game:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 2D Menus
	\item 3D Action
\end{itemize}

Trivia: Actually the engine casted less than 320 rays: Trick used.
 

\section{Unrolled Loop}
Game runs at 70Hz (twice as doom which ran at 35Hz). Framerate comes from the refresh rate of VGA at 320x240. At 640*480, rate it 60hz.
\subsection{Memory Manager (MM)}

\subsection{Page Manager (PM)}

The Page Manager harness the three types of RAM available: Conventional, XMS and XML. It abstract this complexity behind a Paging system.\\
Is it where the loading screen shows a progress bar ?
"Get Psyched !!!": Fill up the cache ?
Trivia: The progress bar was called a "thermometer".
The Page Manager provides all asset during 3D rendition. 
It loads as many "Pages" as possible in Main, XMS and EMS memory during the get Psyched screen.
TODO: Add a screenshot.
It uses a Least Frequency Used eviction policy if not all asset fit in RAM. VSWAP.WL6 is 1.6MB -> Recommended configuration 2MB RAM..but the game would run with just 640KB.
\subsection{Video Manager (VW)}


\subsection{Cache Manager (CA)}
The Cache Manager takes care of all the assets during Menu Phases: Sprites, Music, Sounds.
\subsection{Sound Manager (SD)}
The Sound Manager abstract interaction with all four sound systems supported: PC Speaker, ADLib (Music only), Sound Blaster (Mono), Sound Blaster Pro (Stereo).
\subsection{User Manager (US)}


\subsection{Input Manager (IN)}
Abstract interaction with keyboard and mouse.

\section{Introduction Phase}
The game starts with the "resource summary" which display the available RAM, Inputs and Audio systems. Then it is followed by the title screen and the the disclaimer screen. Subversive spirit.
TODO: Show screenshot.

\section{Renderer: Mode X and Mode Y}
As seen in the Hardware chapter, none of the VGA modes offered could do what a game needed. But game developers found

a way: Mode X \footnote{X-Mode Frequently Asked Questions - By Zoombapup (Phil)  2-Oct-94}. Nobody knows who discovered mode-X but the person who popularized it is Michael Abrash \footnote{Michael Abrash's Graphic Programming Black Book: Chapter 47, page 877.}. The idea is to disable the "convenience" mechanism making the 4 banks appear as one. It is called putting the VGA in unchained mode where each bank of memory (called "plane") is written to individually.\\
With this technique the 64KB of mapped RAM can access the full 256KB of the VGA. This enables a mode offering:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Resolution of 320x200
	\item Double buffering
	\item Storage of sprites in VRAM.
\end{itemize}

Compared to figure 
TODO: New Drawing of VGA RAM.\\
But there is still a problem: Switching the target RAM was very slow. So a routine drawing an horizontal line on the screen:

\begin{verbatim}
void DrawLine(y, color) {
  for(int x=0; x < 320 ; x++) {
    SelectBrank(x % 4);
    WritePixel(x, y, color);   
  }
}
\end{verbatim}\\
Would have been unpractical. But something else can be done if you notice that 320 is a multiple of 4 (320/4=80): If you draw only columns you don't have to change the target plan often.\\
TOOD: Drawing of how column line up in VGA RAM.\\

\section{Menu Phase: 2D Renderer}
The menu phase is renderer by the 2D renderer which is tile based. The screen is divided into tiles as follow:\\

\begin{fancyquotes}
"Call Apogee and say Aardwolf."  It's a sign that to this day is something
that I get asked about a lot.  This is a sign that appears on a wall in a
particularly nasty maze in Episode 2 Level 8 of Wolfenstein 3D.  The sign
was to be the goal in a contest Apogee was going to have, but almost
immediately after the game's release, a large amount of cheat and mapping
programs were released.  With these programs running around, we felt that
it would have been unfair to have the contest and award a prize.  The sign
was still left in the game, but in hindsight, probably should have been
taken out.  To this day, Apogee gets letters and phone calls and asking
what Aardwolf is, frequently with the question, "Has anyone seen this yet?"\\
\\
Also, in a somewhat related issue, letters were shown after the highest score
in the score table in some revisions of the game.  These letters were to be
part of another contest that got scrapped before it got started, where we were
going to have people call in with their scores and tell us the code; we'd then
be able to verify their score.  However, with the cheat programs out there,
this got scrapped too.\\
\\
Basically, "Aardwolf" and the letters mean nothing now.  Also note that if
you found the Aardwolf sign in the game (without cheating), there's a VERY
strong chance that you're stuck in there.  The only way out may be to restart,
or load a saved game from before you went into that maze.\\

\subsection{Fixed point}
\subsection{Raytracing: DDA Algorithm}
Digital Differential Analysis\\
Some ray are not traced ? How does that work ?\\
Precalculated sin-cos.\\
\subsection{FishEye}
The function in charge of calculating the heigh of a wall is CalcHeight:\\

\lstinputlisting[language=C]{code/CalcHeight.c}

The code is not what one would expect: The raytracing algorithm is supposed to cast a ray for each pixel column and use the distance \codeword{d} to infer an other value. So I would have expected to see something like:
\begin{math}
	d = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}
\end{math}

but instead it looks like:
\begin{math}
	d = dx * \cos(\alpha) - dy * \sin(\alpha)
\end{math}.
Something is not right. Or misunderstood here.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
 \input{imgs/fish_eye/state.tex}
 \caption{Raycasting using distance d} \label{fig:Raycasting2}
\end{figure}

In this drawing the player is located at viewpoint with a view angle \begin{math}\alpha\end{math}. The distance \codeword{d} is a straight line between the player point of view and the location where the ray hit the line. Such an algorithm would result in a "fisheye effect". It is not very noticeable when a wall is far:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
 \includegraphics[scale=1.3]{imgs/fish_eye/bad_mild.png}
 \caption{Fish eye effect: Mild}. \label{fig:mips}
 \end{figure}

But it gets worse when you get closer:
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
 \includegraphics[scale=1.3]{imgs/fish_eye/bad_ok.png}
 \caption{Fish eye effect: Bad} \label{fig:mips}
 \end{figure}

And become unbearable when close:
 \begin{figure}[H]
\centering
 \includegraphics[scale=1.3]{imgs/fish_eye/bad_bad.png}
 \caption{Fish eye effect: AAAAARG} \label{fig:mips}
 \end{figure}
 
To avoid this visual annoyance, what must be used is not the direct distance d but d projected on the perpendicular of the view direction:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
 \input{imgs/fish_eye/d_vs_z.tex}
 \caption{blabla.} \label{fig:Raycasting2}
\end{figure}

This projection is mathematically hard to calculate in one go (especially with fixed point). The trick is to break it down in two components and use highschool mnemonic: SOH-CAH-TOA\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
 \input{imgs/fish_eye/correct_way.tex}
 \caption{blabla.} \label{fig:Raycasting2}

 \caption{Fish eye: Corrected} \label{fig:mips}
 \end{figure}
 Note: Why substract values insted of adding them ? The Wolf3D coordinate system has its origin at the upper left. This inverse the sin value. To compensate for it, the correction math uses substraction instead of addition.

\subsection{Ray skipping trick}
A naive implementation of the raycaster would be:\\
\lstinputlisting[language=C]{code/naive_raycaster_pseudocode.c}
But Wolf3D is different: It buffers what to draw:
\lstinputlisting[language=C]{code/wolf3d_raycaster_pseudocode.c}

Rendition is deferred because the engine allows itself to cheat a little: If a ray is cast and hits the same block and in the same
texture column, the two rays are considered similar. If two rays are similar they are drawn at the same height. The visual result is 
barely noticable. But this cheat allows to draw up to eight column of pixel in three write operations (in practice it is more like two columns
with one write operation). The details of this are in the method \codeword{ScalePost} in \codeword{WL\_DRAW.C}.\\

Note: A \quotes{post} is a column of pixel belonging to a wall.\\
ScalePost is written in assembly and performs a maximum of three pass to draw a maximum of eight columns of pixels.
\lstinputlisting[language=C]{code/ScalePost.c}
Because there can be many combinations of VGA bank alignment and number of pixels to draw:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
 \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{imgs/scalePost_explanation1.png}
 \end{figure}
 
 \begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{imgs/scalePost_explanation2.png}
 \end{figure}
The instruction \codeword{or al , al} can be surprising. It means test if al is equal to zero and set the flag. Back in the day it was more populate than \codeword{test al, al}
 the VGA bank masks are harcoded in an array: One for each pass:\\
\lstinputlisting[language=C]{code/hardcoded_masks.c}
TODO: Were images stored rotated 90degres to increase cache hit ? No way, this was aimed at 386. BUT that would make the drawing easier !!

In the following example, the left wall is magnified. several rays hit the wall at the same texture location.
\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=1.3]{imgs/post_optimization_1_pink_show.png}
\end{figure}
The engine takes advantage of it and draw several columns (posts) efficiently with the VGA. The engine was altered to show the optimized posts in pink.
\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=1.3]{imgs/post_optimization_1_show.png}
\end{figure}

In the previous scene, 20\% of the wall was optimized away. In the next two screenshot, the same process, this time with the `eagle' texture:
\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=1.3]{imgs/post_optimization_2_show.png}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=1.3]{imgs/post_optimization_2_pink_show.png}
\end{figure}
 
To draw several column of pixels at the same time, the engine exploit the VGA banks and the masking mechanism seen in the Hardware section.
Since up to eight column can be similar, there are many case of figure depending on the aligment with the VGA banks and how many pixels to draw:

\subsection{Rendering phases}

Upon finishing parameter selection, the engine would switch from Menu phase to Action Phase which was mostly about rendering the 3D environment. The renderer operated in four phases:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Draw Background
   \item Draw Walls
   \item Draw scaled (entities such as enemies and items)
   \item Draw current weapon

Trivia: This type of sprite would later turn out a major issue with hardware accelerated renderer for the iOS port:

\begin{fancyquotes}
Wolfenstein (and Doom) originally drew the characters as sparse stretched columns of solid pixels (vertical instead of horizontal for efficiency in interleaved planar mode-X VGA), but OpenGL versions need to generate a square texture with transparent pixels.  Typically this is then drawn by either alpha blending or alpha testing a big quad that is mostly empty space.  You could play through several early levels of Wolf without this being a problem, but in later levels there are often large fields of dozens of items that stack up to enough overdraw to max out the GPU and drop the framerate to 20 fps.  The solution is to bound the solid pixels in the texture and only draw that restricted area, which solves the problem with most items, but Wolf has a few different heavily used ceiling lamp textures that have a small lamp at the top and a thin but full width shadow at the bottom.  A single bounds doesn't exclude many texels, so I wound up including two bounds, which made them render many times faster.

\subsection{Rendering things}
\subsection{Loading screen}
One interesting aspect: Wall sprites were stored uncompressed but things are compressed in memory and decompressed while drawing occurs via bytecode.

\section{I.A: State Machines}
 
If integers were not accurate enough and floating points were too slow, how could trigonometry be done on those machines? The solution was to re-purpose the hardware via Fixed Points!\\
Fixed Point is a method that allows to keep track of fractions while still using the integer operations of the CPU. The machine manipulates what are supposed to be integer numbers but the programmers sees them as a real numbers. As usual it is easier to describe with a drawing. Integer are encoded following figure \ref{fig:int_layout}:
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
 \input{int.tex}
 \caption{Integer layout.} \label{fig:int_layout}
 \end{figure}

So the value of the sequence of bits \emph{0010010010010010}:
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\input{int_example.tex}
 \caption{Integer example.} \label{fig:mips}
 \end{figure}

 Is equal to $ 2^{13} + 2^9 + 2^5 + 2^1 =  8738 $.

\bigskip


Fixed Point arithmetic works by simply shifting the layout 8 bits to the left:
\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
  \input{fp.tex}
 \caption{Fixed point layout.} \label{fig:mips}
\end{figure}

So the same sequence of bits \emph{0010010010010010}:
\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
   \input{fp_example.tex}
  \caption{Fixed point example.} \label{fig:mips}
\end{figure} 

Now represents:\\
\\
$ 2^5 + 2^1 = 34 $ for the integer part.\\
$ 2^{-3}+2^{-7} = 0.1328125 $ for the fractional part.\\
$ = 34.1328125$\\

\bigskip

The beauty of this method is that addition and subtraction work exactly like integers from the CPU instruction side:

 The only special case is when performing operation.

 \textbf{\underline{Trivia :}}  Fixed Point Arithmetic usage was not limited to PC gaming. Many game console manufactured in the 90s and later had no hardware floating point unit: Sony's original PlayStation (1994) and Sega's Saturn (1994) are few examples among many with a design choice that not only reduced the production cost but also maximized the CPU pipeline throughput.
 
 
 
\begin{fancyquotes}
Much was made about the "ray casting" used in Wolfenstein, but the real reason for it was that I had a lot of trouble with wall-span rendering in Catacombs 3D.  C3D (and Hovertank before that) shipped with various graphics glitches that you could get in some combinations of map block configurations, position, and viewing angle.  Some were due to fixed point precision issues not being handled optimally, and some were due to clipping and culling issues that I didn't really get a handle on until a couple years later.  In any case, they bothered me a lot.  Spurious graphics glitches do a lot of harm to the sense of immersion in a game, and I very much wanted Id games to feel "rock solid".
 \bigskip \\
There was a clear performance cost to it - doing 320 traces through a tile map and treating each column independently is much slower than looping through a few long wall segments.  However, the resulting code was small and very regular compared to the hairball of my wall span renderers, and it did deliver the rock-solid feel I wanted.
 \bigskip \\
If you made extremely jagged block maps that would turn into many dozen independent wall segments, the ray casting could start to look like a good performance choice, but few scenes were even close to that.  This is exactly the same ray tracing versus rasterization performance tradeoff that is still being made today, but now it is "how many tens of millions of triangles per frame to ray tracing break-even" instead of "how many dozen wall segments".
